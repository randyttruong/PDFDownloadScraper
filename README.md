# PDFDownloadScraper 

A small, lightweight Python HTML scraper script that automatically downloads all of the PDFs you need to become the best self-taught programmer you can be! 

## Quickstart Guide: 
```
python3 scraper.py <url> 
```

## TODOS: 
-> Give program a more command-line feel, since right now you have to manually input a page ID in order to scrape a page
